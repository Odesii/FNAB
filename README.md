# FNAB (F**K NOT ANOTHER BLOG)
*Skip this README at your own peril—it's like ignoring the warning label on a firework. Surprisingly common and mildly entertaining for the bystanders.*

## Overview
Welcome to FNAB (FUCK NOT ANOTHER BLOG), the digital equivalent of that drawer everyone has at home filled with old batteries, expired coupons, and keys that open no known locks—or a trash fire that inexplicably draws a crowd. You're here, which means you've either made a terrible mistake or you're incredibly bored. This "platform" is where content goes to die, resurrect, then die again in a slightly more embarrassing manner. It's what happens when someone decides the internet needs yet another place to voice opinions nobody asked for. So, congratulations on finding your way here—clearly, your standards are as questionable as our content strategy. Enjoy the chaos.

## Features
- **Infinite Scroll**: No just No.
- **User Profiles**: NOPE

### DON'T
Honestly, it's better for both of us if you don't try to contact me. If you're desperate, scream into the void; it's just as effective and significantly less annoying for me.
